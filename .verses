Psalms 127:1-2
Unless the Lord builds the house,
They labor in vain who build it;
Unless the Lord guards the city,
The watchman keeps awake in vain.
It is vain for you to rise up early,
To retire late,
To eat the bread of painful labors;
For He gives to His beloved even in his sleep.

Proverbs 16:3
Commit to the LORD whatever you do, and He will establish your plans.

Proverbs 8:12
I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty inventions.

1 Corinthians 2:16
"For who has known the mind of the Lord that he will instruct him?" But we have the mind of Christ.

Lord, I commit this project to you, and I ask that you bless my hands as I work on it. I thank you Lord for the mind of Christ that allows me to write clean, bug-free code, and I thank you Lord that you give me the knowledge of witty inventions and designs.
